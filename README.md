Search and Replace: Opens a window to search for specific text and optionally replace it in the main text box.
Exit: Closes the application.
Figure-of-Merit: Opens a checkbox window to select the desired Figures-of-Merit (FoM).

Constraint: Opens a window to select constraint values.

Iteration: Opens a window to choose iteration options.

Scan Module
This module handles sweeping parameters for 1D and 2D scans:

1D:
Select a parameter to sweep and enter the values as a comma-separated list.
2D:
Choose two parameters to sweep in 2D and enter the values for both as comma-separated lists.
Variable Selection
The menu also offers various categories to select from:

Build: Opens a menu to select variables related to the build process.
Constraint Variables: Choose constraints for the fusion reactor setup.
Cost Variables: Manage cost-related parameters.
Current Drive: Select options for the current drive system.
Divertor Variables: Configure the divertor subsystem settings.
Fwbs Variables: Handle first wall and blanket structure values.
Heat Transport: Control heat transport-related settings.
Impurity Radiation: Set parameters for impurity radiation in the plasma.
Numerics: Fine-tune numerical parameters for the calculations.
CS/pfcoil Variables: Choose settings for the Central Solenoid (CS) and poloidal field (PF) coils.
Physics Variables: Adjust key physics variables affecting the fusion reactor.
Pulse Variables: Manage pulse-related values.
Tfcoil Variables: Set parameters for the toroidal field (TF) coil.
